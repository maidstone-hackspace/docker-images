Quick setup to host your own code with integrated CI service and pastebin.

* Configuration
Edit the .env file with your settings, secret will need changing, the domains may need changin but by default use the container names so should work.
* Setup
Bring up the containers with
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
docker-compose up -d
#+END_SRC

* change something edit the docker compose file env or gitea conf then run these
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
docker-compose down 
docker-compose up -d
#+END_SRC

* NGINX
 This is setup to expose nginx and proxy to gitea and drone, copy the configs to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled and replace mydomain with your domain and generate your certs.

 If you dont want to use nginx disable in docker-compose and expose the ports of the other containers to the outside world.
